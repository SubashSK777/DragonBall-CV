Welcome to the Computer Vision for Games! This project is designed to enable computer vision-based control for games using Python. The program utilizes OpenCV, CVZone, and Pynput libraries to offer a versatile solution for games that don't rely on mouse input.

Features:

Computer Vision Control: The program employs computer vision techniques to interpret hand gestures, allowing users to control games without the need for a mouse.

Flexibility in Game Compatibility: This project is designed to work seamlessly with a wide range of games, as long as they don't require mouse input. Feel free to experiment and adapt it to suit your favorite games.

Easily Customizable Controls: The control scheme is highly adaptable to your preferences. You can easily customize the controls to suit your gaming style.
