# DragonBall-CV

Welcome to **DragonBall-CV: Computer Vision for Games!** This project harnesses the power of computer vision, enabling gesture-based game control using Python. We leverage OpenCV, CVZone, and Pynput libraries to offer an innovative and versatile solution for games that don't rely on mouse input.

## Features

- **Computer Vision Control**: Utilize computer vision techniques to interpret hand gestures, enabling hands-free game control.

- **Game Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly with various games, provided they donâ€™t require mouse input. Feel free to experiment and adapt it to your favorite games.

- **Customizable Controls**: The control scheme is easily adaptable to your gaming style. Customize the controls to match your preferences effortlessly.
